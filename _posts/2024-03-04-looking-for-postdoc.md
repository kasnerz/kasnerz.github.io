Do you want proof that humans sometimes generate sentences with low probability? 

Here is one: 

*Four years of PhD have persuaded me that I want to stay in academia.*

<!-- To me, universities are the only working environment that makes me feel good. -->

Because there is no other place where you can do various things simply out of curiosity or a sense of purpose without being motivated by money. (Says a person who just finished reviewing üòÖ)

Or because you are exposed to the students' way of thinking, which prevents you from seeing the world too seriously.

Or because nothing can replace the feeling of walking into a university anywhere on this planet and starting to work in a study room on the *eduroam* wi-fi?


Anyway, I am **looking for a post-doc position**! üë®‚Äçüéì

And along with that, I would like to start working on some of the questions that I am genuinely curious about:

- To what extent is the intelligent behavior of LLMs built on solid world models (as opposed to memorization and shallow statistics)?
- Can we identify the minimal combination of data, training objectives, and model architectures needed to achieve proficiency on specific tasks?
- Are there problems beyond the scope of current architectures (such as planning ahead with autoregressive decoding)?
- And how is this all related to the way humans think? 

Some of my works already focus on similar questions, investigating the [generalization abilities of pretrained LMs](https://aclanthology.org/2023.eacl-main.176/) and [behaviors of open LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10186) on the task of data-to-text generation. 

In my future research, I would like to move even closer to **understanding what the models are doing**, delving deeper into model interpretability.

If you know of a position that would be a good fit, please [let me know](mailto:kasner@ufal.mff.cuni.cz)! 


And if you wonder whether I am a good candidate:
- Here is my [CV](/assets/cv/cv.pdf), my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.cz/citations?user=6NnuRB8AAAAJ&hl=cs), and the [summary of my research projects](/research).
- Even though I have not (directly) worked on the aforementioned topics, I am deeply familiar with the related NLP and machine learning techniques.
- I already spent quite some time getting familiar with the literature in these areas.
- I am very enthusiastic about these topics, ready to learn and experiment.
- And if you are still not persuaded, I am ready to talk to you!

**I am attending ICLR 2024, so I am also open to an in-person meeting in Vienna.**
