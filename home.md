## About

I am a **PhD student** at the [Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/), Charles University, Prague. But here it might be more appropriate to say that I am just a guy who likes to test new ideas. Or that I am a graphomaniac with a withdrawal syndrome.

Let's just say it is hard to describe a person in a single sentence.
