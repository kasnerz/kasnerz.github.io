Oh, hello again! Here you can find a little bit more about me.

I learned many things at my alma mater <img src="assets/icons/cvut.png" style="display: inline"> [Czech Technical University](https://cvut.cz/) , before I moved on to <img src="assets/icons/cuni.png" style="display: inline"> [Charles University](https://cuni.cz/) (both in Prague) to pursue a PhD in Computational Lingustics.

For every thing I learned at the university, I learned two at <img src="assets/icons/best.png" style="display: inline"> [Board of European Student of Technology](https://best.eu.org) This student organization has been a part of my life for almost five years and the life lessons I got from here are priceless. 

I am still looking for new **volunteering** <i class="fa fa-people-arrows"></i> opportunities ‚Äì organizing local festivals and other events, helping as a buddy, going to workcamps, etc.

I love **traveling** as much as anybody else, but I mostly like to visit tucked away places, meet local people and  <img src="assets/x.jpg" style="display: inline"> [push my boundaries](https://x-challenge.cz/) .

**Languages** <i class="fa fa-language"></i> are not just my work, but my hobby. I want to practice French or Dutch in the future again. And yes, I also learned Japanese, and no, I cannot speak it (well, nor can I speak the former two).

Recently I started to learn to play **guitar** <i class="fa fa-guitar"></i>  and I can't wait for summer campfires...

In general, I would describe myself as an **introvert** who likes socializing, meeting new people, and finding myself in new and uncomfortable situations üôÉ

Besides all of this, I also enjoy some other things which ‚Äì for some reason ‚Äì are even less mainstream:

- My only operating system is **Linux Mint** <img src="assets/icons/mint.png" style="display: inline">, and I didn't need to use Windows for... well, almost an eternity now.
- I like **writing long texts** <i class="fas fa-pen-nib"></i> instead of posting pictures with hashtags  or tweeting, so I mostly avoid being active on social networks.
- My most favourite music genres are **folk / progressive / symphonic metal** <i class="fa fa-music"></i> and I still have to find out why people don't listen to them much more.
- The more punk my travels are, the better. Hitchhiking, camping outside, [Couchsurfing](https://www.couchsurfing.com)...  <img src="assets/icons/cs.png" style="display: inline"> (trains at Balkan or Ukraine also fit).
- I use <i class="fas fa-tram"> [shared bikes](https://www.nextbikeczech.com) <i class="fas fa-bicycle"></i> a lot and I do not miss having a car at all. Also, I like the [14 T trams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%A0koda_14_T)</i> the most (which is definitely not a mainstream opinion in Prague).
- To make the list complete: I have no opinion whatsoever on a **pizza with pineapple**. üçï

And I usually avoid people taking pictures of me. Here's why:
