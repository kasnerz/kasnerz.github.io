I'm a second year PhD student at the [Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics](ufal.mff.cuni.cz/), Charles University, Prague.

At the same time, I am just guy with many interests and ideas who wanted a website with a blog so that he could write about them.

This website is a compromise: it looks professional at the first sight.
