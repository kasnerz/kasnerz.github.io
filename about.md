## TL;DR
I am a **second-year PhD student** at the [Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/), Charles University, Prague. But here it might be more appropriate to say that I am just a guy who likes to test new ideas. Or that I am a graphomaniac with a withdrawal syndrome.

Let's just say it is hard to describe a person in a single sentence.

You will have to read on üòÅ

## Website
This is my **personal website**. I have also an [official academic website](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/zdenek-kasner) <i class="fa fa-university"></i> and a [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zdenek-kasner/) <i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i>. If you are interested in my research, have a look also at the [Research](research) tab (but the descriptions are quite informal).

On this website, I just want to ["talk"](blog) <i class="fa fa-comment-alt"></i>. By which I mean:
- **Explain** simply the concepts that I am familiar with.
- **Share** ideas which I find interesting (in better way than just clicking the *Share* button). 
- **Collect the thoughts** floating in my head.

Regarding the last point, I still wonder why I decided to use a public website for that.




<!-- But mainly there is this crazy idea that writing my thoughts on a public website will help to clear them up. -->

## [Me¬≤](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3b1ozq)
I learned many things at my alma mater [Czech Technical University](https://cvut.cz/) <img src="assets/cvut.png" style="display: inline">, before I moved on to [Charles University](https://cuni.cz/) <img src="assets/cuni.png" style="display: inline"> (both in Prague) to pursue a PhD in Computational Lingustics.


For every thing I learned at the university, I learned two at [Board of European Student of Technology](https://best.eu.org) <img src="assets/best.png" style="display: inline">. This student organization has been a part of my life for almost five years, and the life lessons I got from here are priceless. 

Even now, I am always looking for new **volunteering** <i class="fa fa-people-arrows"></i> opportunities ‚Äì organizing local [festivals](https://www.prahazijehudbou.cz) and [events](https://milionchvilek.cz), helping as a [buddy](https://esncuprague.cz), going to [workcamps](https//tamjdem.cz), etc.

I love **traveling** as much as anybody else, but I like to visit more tucked away places, meet local people and  [push my boundaries](https://x-challenge.cz/) <img src="assets/x.jpg" style="display: inline"> .


Recently I started to learn to play **guitar** <i class="fa fa-guitar"></i> on my own, and I can't wait for summer campfires...

**Languages** <i class="fa fa-language"></i> are another of my hobbies. I want to practice French or Dutch in the future again. And yes, I also learned Japanese, and no, I cannot speak it (well, nor can I speak the former two üòÅ).

I also read books and listen to podcasts, but because everyone does that, it deserves to dig a bit deeper (and I will!).

Besides all of this, I also enjoy some other things which ‚Äì for some reason ‚Äì are even less mainstream:

- My only operating system is **Linux Mint 20.1** <img src="assets/mint.png" style="display: inline">, and I didn't need to use Windows for... well, almost an eternity now.
- The more punk my travels are, the better. Hitchhiking, camping outside, [Couchsurfing](https://www.couchsurfing.com)...  <img src="assets/cs.png" style="display: inline"> (trains at Balkan or Ukraine also fit).
- I like **writing long texts** <i class="fas fa-pen-nib"></i> instead of posting pictures with hashtags  or tweeting, so I mostly avoid socializing on social networks (although Twitter good as an information source).
- My most favourite music genres are **folk / progressive / symphonic metal** <i class="fa fa-music"></i> and I still have to find out why people don't listen to them much more.
- I use [shared bikes](https://www.nextbikeczech.com) <i class="fas fa-bicycle"></i> a lot, and I do not miss having a car at all. Also, I like the [14 T trams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%A0koda_14_T) <i class="fas fa-tram"></i> the most (which is definitely not a mainstream opinion in Prague).
- To make the list complete: I have no opinion whatsoever on a **pizza with pineapple**. üçï

And I usually avoid people taking pictures of me. Here's why:
