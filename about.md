I learned a lot at my alma mater <img src="assets/icons/cvut.png" style="display: inline"> [Czech Technical University](https://cvut.cz/) , before I moved on to <img src="assets/icons/cuni.png" style="display: inline"> [Charles University](https://cuni.cz/) (both in Prague) where I currently work on [NLP research](/research).

For every thing I learned at the university, I learned two at the <img src="assets/icons/best.png" style="display: inline"> [Board of European Student of Technology](https://best.eu.org). This student organization has been a part of my life for almost five years and the life lessons I got from here are priceless. 

I love **travelling**: I have visited over 30 countries so far. Out of these, I have lived in Belgium, Japan, and Scotland for several months. And although Prague is still my favourite city, I would definitely like to spend some time abroad again.

I am currently involved in the  <img src="assets/icons/x.jpg" style="display: inline"> [X-Challenge](https://x-challenge.cz/) community, which helps me to further push my boundaries and experience life to its fullest (however cheesy that may sound). I am also always looking for new <i class="fa fa-people-arrows"></i> **volunteering** opportunities – organizing local festivals and events, helping as a buddy, going to workcamps, etc.

**Languages** are not just my work, but also my hobby. I definitely want to practice French and Dutch in the future again. I also learned a bit of Japanese, but I'm not sure I will be ever be able to learn it properly 😁

Recently I started to learn to play <i class="fa fa-guitar"></i> **guitar** and I already expanded my [songbook](/projects) by quite a bit!

In general, I would describe myself as an **introvert** who likes socializing, meeting new people, and finding myself in new and uncomfortable situations. And I think it is important not to take life too seriously 🙃

Besides all of this, I also enjoy some other things which – for some reason – are even less mainstream:

- My only operating system is <img src="assets/icons/mint.png" style="display: inline"> **Linux Mint** and I didn't need to use Windows for... well, almost an eternity now.
- I prefer <i class="fas fa-pen-nib"></i>  **writing long texts** to posting pictures with hashtags, so I mostly tend to avoid being active on social media. I would still love to start blogging if only I had extra time!
- My favourite music genres are <i class="fa fa-music"></i> **progressive / folk / symphonic metal** which are beautifully complex and powerful forms of music, even though not many people think so.
- The more punk my travels are, the better. Hitchhiking, camping outside, <img src="assets/icons/vlakfest.png" style="display: inline"> [train festivals](https://vlakfest.cz/), <img src="assets/icons/cs.png" style="display: inline"> [couchsurfing](https://www.couchsurfing.com/people/zdenek-kasner)...
- I enjoy compact phones, especially with my [custom](/assets/keyboard.png) <img src="assets/icons/multilingo.webp" style="display: inline"> [Multiling-o](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=kl.ime.oh) keyboard, and I hope that smaller phones will come into fashion again.
- I am a big fan of <i class="fas fa-bicycle"></i> [shared bikes](https://www.nextbikeczech.com) and I do not miss having a car at all. Also, I like the <i class="fas fa-tram"></i> [14 T trams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%A0koda_14_T) the most (which is definitely not a mainstream opinion in Prague).
- To make the list complete: I have no opinion whatsoever on a pizza with pineapple. 🍕
