After the brief introduction of the Transformer architecture, we focus on various practical aspects of language modeling. We also put emphasis on group assignments and reading research papers. In the first run, I was teaching the lecture on LLM inference and preparing the first practical assigment. I am helping with the course again in 24/25.<br><br>#llmsgobrrr<br>#hypeornohype"
