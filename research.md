My research revolves around improving **data-to-text generation** systems.

The projects I have worked on include:
- domain-independent and low-resource data-to-text generation [[1]](#d2t-llm), [[2]](#neural_pipeline), [[3]](#iterative_editing),
- evaluating semantic accuracy of generated text [[1]](#d2t-llm), [[4]](#text_in_context), [[5]](#semacc),
- investigating the role of data labels [[6]](#rel2text).
- software toolkit for data-to-text generation [[7]](#tabgenie).

I focus on developing efficient representations of structured data, so that the data can be used as an input to pretrained language models for generating automated reports.

During my internship at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/), I was working on applying LLMs for autonomous web navigation.

In the future, I would also like to delve deeper into **model interpretability**: how is the information inside the language models represented, how do language models reason, and how this all relates to human cognition.
