I work on building systems which can accurately describe **structured data** (graphs, tables, charts, etc.).

<!-- Here is an illustration of how such "data-to-text generation" may look like: -->

In my research (see [[1]](#neural_pipeline), [[2]](#iterative_editing), [[3]](#text_in_context)), I focus on combining two approaches:
- using **templates and rules** for transforming the data to text,
- using **pretrained neural models** such as BART or T5 for postprocessing the text.

My other research interests (ranging from "I digged into that a little bit" up to "if only I had more time") include:
- evaluating quality of generated texts,
- story generation,
- logical and commonsense reasoning,
- language processing in human brain.
