In my research, I focus on making sure that **large language models (LLMs) generate accurate text**.

The projects I have worked on include:
- domain-independent and low-resource data-to-text generation [[1]](#d2t-llm), [[2]](#neural_pipeline), [[3]](#iterative_editing),
- evaluating semantic accuracy of generated text [[4]](#text_in_context), [[5]](#semacc), [[8]](#factgenie), [[9]](#d2t-llm), [[10]](#llm-span-annot),
- investigating the role of data labels [[6]](#rel2text),
- a software toolkit for data-to-text generation [[7]](#tabgenie).

During my internship at [Milaâ€“Quebec AI institute](https://mila.quebec/), I was also working on applying LLMs for autonomous web navigation [[11]](#weblinx).

If I only had enough time, I would dig into many more things! For example, I am interested in how is the information inside the language models represented, how this all relates to human cognition, and how can we use AI tools to make our lives better.
