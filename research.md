##  Research Area
Currently, I focus on my dissertation thesis topic: *Domain Adaptation for Natural Language Generation*.

The task is to generate *text* from *data* across **multiple domains**. If a model can generate weather reports, why shouldn't it be able to generate route instructions? People do both tasks pretty well (at least people that can read maps), so should our models!

Generating text from data is not an easy task. Joining together existing sentences is easier! We train a neural model for sentence fusion, convert data to simple sentences and iteratively join the sentences with the neural model.
